This is a collection of tests for the IDX Broker API.

#Standard Disclaimer: 
This code is not official IDX Broker code. It does use their API, but in NO WAY is it supported by IDX Broker. DO NOT contact IDX Broker for any support of this code. This alo applies to any CRM in this repo. It does use their API, but in NO WAY is it supported by them. DO NOT contact them for any support of this code.

This repo uses a lot of API calls. Keep that in mind if you choose to run these with your API key.

Rate limits are 125 for Lite and 250 for Platinum pet key per hour.

You will need to have an active IDX Broker account and an active API key.

This script will not employ ancillary keys at this time.

My testing scripting and testing may change in the future.

As new methods are added to an API version this may change the scripting to accommodate these new methods. See API docs http://middleware.idxbroker.com/docs/api/overview.php

You can save the url string if you need to run the same test agent in the future.

If you do not wish to deal with my changes to testing criteria, please fork this repo and develop as you see fit.

Not all GETS are testing yet.
Testing for PUT, POST, and DELETE not yet added.
